1. Disease & Population
Lupus Nephritis is a systemic autoimmune disease. Systemic means that it can potentially affect 
all body organs and tissues. Autoimmune means that the immune system instead of fighting 
infections and tumours, it starts to attack body tissues. Genetic problems, sunlight exposure, 
hormonal reasons, and infections may be the reason for the immune system dysfunction.

Autoimmune B-lymphocytes produce autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), 
anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith and antiphospholipid antibodies. These are often used by doctors to 
help make the diagnosis of lupus. 

Autoantibodies bind self-particles like DNA, and cell proteins, The complexes they form 
(immune complexes) travel in the blood circulation and go to different organs. There they cause 
inflammation by different mechanisms including the activation of "complement factors" C4 
and C3. 

Systematic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, is an autoimmune disease that can affect nearly every 
organ system and has a wide range of clinical presentations. One of the most dangerous side 
effects of SLE is kidney involvement. There is still much to learn about the mechanisms of 
action underlying SLE and its complex etiopathogenesis. The risk of SLE is an excessive 
generation of radioactive debris as a result of aberrant and massive apoptotic events that are 
mistaken for foreign bodies. This abnormal antigen presentation eventually results in a loss of 
tolerance to B and T cells. Due to this loss of tolerance, T cells become hyperactive, which in 
turn causes the production of inflammatory cytokines. B cells also become hyperactive, which 
results in the massive production of autoantibodies and the development of immune response

Most common symptoms: 

• Joint pain, stiffness in the morning, and swelling (mostly hands) 

• Skin rash after exposure to the sun (butterfly rash) 

• Chest pain with deep breathing (pleurisy or pericarditis) 

• Leg swelling due to lupus nephritis

Less common symptoms: 
• Muscle weakness, 

• Low blood count (anaemia), bruising (low platelets), blood clots Seizures, psychosis, 
stroke

Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most important organ involvement in SLE.Up to 30-50% of lupus 
patients may develop nephritis (usually within 3 years from diagnosis). Inflammation in the 
kidney causes protein leakage in the urine (proteinuria), leg swelling (edema due to fluid 
retention), and worse kidney function (measured by serum creatinine test) Lupus nephritis 
tends to come back even after it gets better Repeated flares cause scarring in the kidney (not 
reversible) Up to 20-30% of patients with Lupus Nephritis may develop renal failure and will 
require a kidney transplant or dialysis(haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) Only rarely it can 
happen again after kidney transplantation

Diagnosis of Lupus Nephritis symptoms

• New/worse high blood pressure (hypertension) 

• Edema of feet and/or around eyes. 

• Polyuria ornocturia 

• Frothy urine (proteinuria); Urine discolouration (haematuria) 

• It may have no symptoms(Urinalysis is critical) 


Blood tests: 

• Serum creatinine (normally <1 in the average woman; it may be higher in muscular 
men as it reflects muscle mass). 
• Albumin (normal>3.5) which may be decreased due to loss of protein in the urine. 

• Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, fasting lipids (often high), glucose, 
vitamin D 

• Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). Calculated by using creatinine, age, 
and gender. Normally 90-120 ml/min/1.73m2 

• Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anaemia or low counts of white blood cells 
and platelets 

• Tests for exposure to Tuberculosis , hepatitis B/C, or HIV 

Urine tests: 

• Urinalysis. Normally 0-trace protein, no red and white blood cells (<5 RBC, <5 
WBC) 

• 24-h urine protein (we also measure creatinine to assess whether the collection was 
performed properly): normally <150 mg/24h. In Lupus by definition>500 mg/24 hour. 
If the urine protein is >3,500 mg/24 hours, we call this nephrotic range proteinuria 

• Urine protein/creatinine ratio. Either spot or 24-hour urine collection. 
Renal Ultrasound: to exclude urine flow obstruction, scarring of the kidney or other causes 
of kidney disease 

Kidney Biopsy :

• It helps confirm the diagnosis of lupus nephritis and exclude other causes of kidney 
disease 

• It helps establish the class of lupus nephritis as management is different 

• It helps assess the amount of activity/inflammation (reversible) versus the amount of 
chronicity/scarring (irreversible): Activity index (Al) and Chronicity index (CI) 

Risks: 

• Kidney biopsy is a low-risk procedure. Patients can go home the same day if no 
complications 

• Under ultrasound or CT scan imaging, a needle is inserted into the lower part of one 
kidney and a tiny tube-like piece is taken for microscopic analysis 

• Blood pressure should be well controlled and anticoagulants held to minimize the 
chance of bleeding around the kidney.


Classification of Lupus Nephritis :

• Class I. Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (LN) 

• Class II. Mesangial proliferative LN 

• Class III. Focal LN (less than 50% of glomeruli are involved) 

• Class IV. Diffuse LN (more than 50% of glomeruli are involved)

• Class V. Membranous LN 

• Class VI. Advanced sclerosing LN

A patient might have either: 

• Class III/IV LN, or Class V LN or 

• both Class III/IV+Class V 

• Class III or IV nephritis (with or without Class V) is worse than Class V LN because 
it often affects kidney function. It requires more aggressive treatment 

• Class V nephritis (membranous) without Class III/IV LN causes proteinuria without 
affecting kidney function in the beginning. 

• However, Class V can cause severe (nephrotic) proteinuria, with often very bad leg 
edema, and high cholesterol, and may cause a blood clot. This needs to be treated 
more aggressively. 

Population:

• Lupus is much more common in women than in men and most often strikes during the 
childbearing years. Nine out of 10 people who have lupus are women. 

• Lupus is also more common in people of African or Asian background. African 
Americans and Asian Americans are about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop lupus 
than Caucasians. In the United States, 1 out of every 250 African American women 
will develop lupus.

• SLE (systematic lupus erythematosus) is a disease of young or middle-aged women. 
About 1 per 1,000-5,000. The ratio of females to males affected is 9:1 
• The disease is more frequent and often more severe in non-Caucasians.

DATA ACQUISTION

"Data for this project was obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public 
repository. We searched GEO using keywords ‘lupus nephritis’, ‘chronic kidney disease’ , 
‘Homo Sapiens’and certain criteria such as a sample size of above 50 and gene expression 
profile. The selected dataset (GEO Series accession number: GSE200306) profiled gene 
expression in glomerular tissues and controls. The series matrix file was downloaded for 
analysis and normalised glomeruli expression data was also obtained from database.

The overall design used in the dataset was 58 paired kidney biopsies from patients with 
proliferative lupus nephritis (class III, class IV or class III/IV+V) that were initially 
evaluated. This is a well-defined, well-curated dataset with clinical and histologic data 
available for all patients. Glomeruli and tubulointerstitium (TI) were isolated separately and 
samples with adequate RNA were submitted for nanostring analysis. Overall, 70 glomerular 
samples and 92 TI samples were submitted for nanostring analysis (35 glomerular and 46 TI 
pairs). Pre-implantation donor kidney biopsies (n=10) served as healthy controls.

Data processing:For nanostring data, raw counts were normalized to the positive spike-in 
controls and then log2 transformed. To reduce technical bias, genes with an expression level 
below the mean plus two standard deviations of the negative controls were filtered out. Quantile 
normalization was applied to the remaining transcripts (522 for glomeruli and 502 for TI). 
Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify differentially expressed genes by taking into 
account the correlation between repeated measures before and after treatment. To improve the 
stability of variance estimation, moderated t-tests were employed for differential expression 
detection.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:

The data chosen has 181 samples out of which 79 glomeruli tissue samples were taken for this 
analysis 28 class 3 Lupus Nephritis and 31 class4 Lupus Nephritis and 9 control samples of 
glomeruli tissues were further considered for Data preprocessing and exploration to find 
potential targets for Lupus Nephritis by finding genes up or downregulated in the pathway 
leading to calcineurin activation. A phosphatase called calcineurin is involved in the synthesis 
of inflammatory mediators by T cells as well as the upkeep and appropriate operation of the 
glomerular filtration membrane, both of which are critical for the development of lupus 
nephritis. As a result, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are a promising tactic for blocking T cells, 
and in recent years, CNI-based research and clinical trials have grown dramatically. The use 
and mechanisms of action of CNIs as a therapeutic approach for LN are the main topics of this 
review, along with the role of calcineurin in the pathogenesis of SLE.
